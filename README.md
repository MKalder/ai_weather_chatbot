# AI Weather Chatbot

<img src="images/weather_chatbot.png" alt="Chatbot" width="20%">

## Description
The Weather Chatbot is designed to provide real-time and interactive weather updates through natural language queries, offering a more intuitive and user-friendly alternative to conventional weather applications.

The primary motivation behind developing this chatbot stemmed from a deep curiosity about conversational AI and its potential to address a wide range of practical challenges. Additionally, this project served as an exploration into the seamless integration of a dedicated chatbot using freely available software. The objective was to assess how effectively such a system could be tailored for natural and intuitive user interactions.

The chatbot is available for testing here: https://mariuskalder.io/ai-weather-chatbot/ 

From a technical perspective, this project provides a solid foundation for further exploration into the core principles of Natural Language Processing (NLP). While Google Dialogflow ES handles essential NLP tasks such as tokenization, normalization, stemming, and named entity recognition autonomously, developers retain significant control over model training. This includes curating training data (intents), defining context to steer user interactions effectively, and optimizing entity recognition to ensure precise and contextually relevant responses. 

## Architecture

<img src="images/architecture.png" alt="Architecture" width="80%">

The chatbot follows a modular architecture with three key components:
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Handled by Google Dialogflow ES (GDF) for intent recognition and seamless integration.
2. Weather Data Retrieval: Queries OpenWeatherMap (OWM) API for real-time weather updates.
3. Webhook Processing: A Flask-based web application hosted on Pythonanywhere ensures formatted responses and manages invalid requests.

## Scope & Features

- Recognize and respond to queries about temperature, weather conditions, and wind speed.
- Understand both simple and detailed queries (e.g., “What’s the weather in Paris today?” vs. “What will the wind speed be in London tomorrow?”).
- Real data via OpenWeatherMap API
- Only current and max 5 days in advance weatherforecast data
- Operate 24/7 and integrate into a website for easy access across devices.

## Technology Used

- Google Dialogflow ES: Simplifies NLP processing and multi-platform integration (free version).
- OpenWeatherMap API: Chosen for its reliability and extensive free data access (free version).
- Flask Webhook: Handles API calls and responses, hosted on Pythonanywhere (free trial available - up to 3 months hosting).
- Ngrok: To create a secure tunnel from your local machine to the internet (free version)
- My Website: Embedded the chatbot into a Blogpost 
- Git and GitHub 

# Installation
Follow these steps to run the chatbot within the Google Diaogflow ES Website and a locally hosted webhook.
